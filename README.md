## Overview

**odin4** is a modern, open-source Samsung firmware flashing tool specifically designed for Linux environments. It provides a clean, correct, and robust implementation of the Thor USB protocol, offering a reliable alternative for Samsung device maintenance and development workflows on Linux.

The project emphasizes:

*   **Correct Protocol Behavior**: Adherence to the Thor USB protocol specifications for reliable communication.
*   **Strong Validation**: Comprehensive checks before flashing to prevent device bricking or data corruption.
*   **Structured Logging**: Detailed and organized logging for easier debugging and operational oversight.
*   **Deterministic and Safe Flashing Logic**: Ensuring predictable and secure flashing operations.
*   **Clean and Maintainable C++ Code**: A well-structured codebase that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

## Why odin4?

- Works natively on Linux (no Wine needed)
- Open-source and auditable
- Safer validation system
- Better logging and debugging tools

## Core Features

odin4 offers a comprehensive set of features for flashing Samsung devices:

*   **Samsung Download Mode Detection**: Automatic detection of devices in Download Mode via `libusb`.
*   **Native Thor Protocol Implementation**: A custom, native implementation of the Thor protocol for efficient and accurate flashing.
*   **Automatic PIT Retrieval and Parsing**: Automatically retrieves and parses Partition Information Table (PIT) data from devices.
*   **Strict Partition Validation**: Ensures that firmware partitions match the device's PIT, preventing mismatches.
*   **Support for Standard Samsung Firmware Packages**: Compatible with common firmware components:
    *   **BL** (Bootloader)
    *   **AP** (Application Processor)
    *   **CP** (Modem/Phone)
    *   **CSC** (Consumer Software Customization)
    *   **UMS** (USB Mass Storage - less common in modern devices)
*   **`.tar.md5` Integrity Verification**: Verifies the integrity of `.tar.md5` firmware archives using **Crypto++**.
*   **Streaming Flash Support**: Efficient flashing for various image types:
    *   Raw images
    *   **LZ4-compressed images** (for faster transfers)
*   **Per-file Flashing Progress Reporting**: Provides detailed progress for each file being flashed.
*   **Transfer Statistics**: Displays real-time statistics including size, elapsed time, and average speed.
*   **Persistent Log File**: Generates a `odin4.log` file for post-operation analysis and debugging.
*   **Sequential Multi-device Flashing**: Supports flashing multiple devices sequentially when no specific device is targeted with `-d`.
*   **Safe Dry-run Mode**: The `--check-only` option allows validation of PIT and archives without performing any actual flashing, ensuring safety.

## Safety and Validation

odin4 prioritizes device safety by enforcing strict checks before any write operations:

*   **Firmware Integrity Verification**: Ensures the firmware is not corrupted or tampered with.
*   **Partition Name Validation against PIT**: Prevents flashing incorrect partitions to the wrong locations.
*   **Device Model Compatibility Check**: Verifies that the firmware is compatible with the connected device model.
*   **Explicit Flashing Control Flow**: Requires clear commands for flashing, reducing accidental operations.
*   **Optional Dry-run Execution**: Allows users to simulate the flashing process for validation without risk.

The tool is designed to be non-destructive and explicitly avoids high-risk operations such as NAND erase or forced repartitioning, which could lead to irreversible device damage.

## Getting Started

To use odin4, you will need to build it from source on your Linux system.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following packages installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build zip make pkg-config g++ libusb-1.0-0-dev libcrypto++-dev
```

### Building from Source

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Llucs/odin4.git
    cd odin4
    ```
2.  **Compile the project**:
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
    ```

Upon successful compilation, the `odin4` executable will be located in the `build/` directory.

## Usage

The `odin4` tool is operated via the command line. Here are the available options and common usage examples.

### Command-Line Options

### Examples

*   **List devices in Download Mode**:
    ```bash
    ./build/odin4 -l
    ```

*   **Flash firmware (all components)**:
    ```bash
    ./build/odin4 \ 
      -b BL_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -a AP_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -c CP_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -s CSC_XXXX.tar.md5
    ```

*   **Flash a specific device with selected components**:
    ```bash
    ./build/odin4 -d /dev/bus/usb/001/002 \ 
      -b BL_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -a AP_XXXX.tar.md5
    ```

*   **Perform a dry-run (validation only)**:
    ```bash
    ./build/odin4 --check-only \ 
      -b BL_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -a AP_XXXX.tar.md5
    ```

*   **Reboot device after flashing**:
    ```bash
    ./build/odin4 --reboot \ 
      -b BL_XXXX.tar.md5 \ 
      -a AP_XXXX.tar.md5
    ```

## Linux USB Permissions

If odin4 reports `LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS` during operation, it indicates a permission issue with accessing USB devices. To resolve this, you need to install the udev rule provided with this repository:

1.  **Copy the udev rule**: Copy `udev/60-odin4.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/60-odin4.rules`.
    ```bash
    sudo cp udev/60-odin4.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/60-odin4.rules
    ```
2.  **Reload udev rules**: Inform the system about the new rule.
    ```bash
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    sudo udevadm trigger
    ```
3.  **Reconnect your device**: Unplug and then re-plug your Samsung device (in Download Mode) to apply the new permissions.

This rule specifically targets known Samsung Download Mode USB Vendor IDs (`04e8`) and Product IDs (`6601`, `685d`, `68c3`) to grant appropriate access.

## Project Status

The odin4 project is actively maintained and developed with a production-oriented mindset. Its core components, including protocol behavior, validation logic, and firmware handling, are implemented with a strong focus on correctness and reliability. Future improvements will continue to concentrate on refinement, handling of edge cases, and ensuring long-term stability.
